2. Property was accessed during render but was not defined on instance. 

This message appears when there is html that uses this syntax: {{ someProperty }} to display vue data
but that property isn't defined anywhere in the vue code. It's safe to ignore it if the application is still 
being built but I wouldn't expect the error to show up on a completed app unless maybe somehow the property 
is dynamically created and it is acceptable for it not to exist for some reason. 

But as it pertains to me, it's probably indicative of the fact that I'm still working on the app, 
or I've made a mistake and forgetten to add that property to the vue data. Adding the property should
fix the error.
